# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTOR
To develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card  transactions in real-time or near real-time using pattern recognition and anomaly  detection techniques

Tools & Environment: 
● Programming Language: Python 
● Libraries & Frameworks: 
○ Pandas, NumPy (data processing) 
○ Scikit-learn (ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) 
○ Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization) 
○ Imbalanced-learn (for handling skewed data) 
● Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab 

Key Work Done: 
● Imported and cleaned the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset 
● Handled class imbalance using SMOTE and under-sampling 
● Performed EDA to visualize transaction patterns 
● Applied correlation analysis to identify important features 
● Trained and evaluated multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random 
Forest, XGBoost) 
● Used confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall to measure 
performance 
● Optimized model with hyperparameter tuning 
● Visualized fraud vs non-fraud patterns using PCA/TSNE
